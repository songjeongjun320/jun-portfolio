        'Enhanced host tools with vehicle management (bulk actions, search, filters) and an offline booking system integrated into a unified calendar.',
      details: `Problem: The host dashboard lacked advanced tools for managing vehicles and offline bookings. Key issues included inefficient client-side filtering, incorrect booking conflict checks, and several UI bugs.

What I changed:
- **Host Vehicle Management:** Introduced a new page with server-side search, filtering, and pagination for the host's vehicle fleet. Implemented bulk actions (activate, deactivate, delete) to improve efficiency.
- **Offline Booking System:** Created a feature for hosts to manually add bookings made outside the platform. This includes a creation modal and a separate page to view and manage these bookings.
- **Unified Calendar:** Updated the vehicle booking calendar to display both online and offline bookings, with different styling for clarity.
- **Bug Fixes & Refinements:**
  - Consolidated vehicle filtering logic into the parent component to avoid multiple re-renders.
  - Corrected the booking conflict check to use correct status enums and exclude completed bookings.
  - Fixed the logic for identifying offline bookings in the calendar view.
  - Addressed UI bugs, like using the correct icon for a close button and preventing nested link navigation.

Result: Hosts now have a powerful, centralized system to manage their fleet and all bookings, improving operational efficiency and providing a clearer overview of vehicle availability.`,

      details: `Problem: Inaccurate date overlap calculations, poor debugging visibility in the search flow, and brittle error handling for optimized DB queries.

What I changed:
- **Availability Logic:** Corrected and unified date overlap logic in Supabase queries (.gt('end_date', startDate).lt('start_date', endDate)) and client-side checks for consistency and accuracy.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented a safer, pessimistic fallback in client-side availability checks, returning \`false\` on error to prevent overbooking. Enhanced the optimized search to gracefully fall back to a basic search if the database function is missing.
- **Debugging & Performance:** Added extensive logging to trace the search flow and refactored a multi-pass filter into a more efficient single-pass operation. (Note: Debug logs to be removed before production merge).

Result: More reliable vehicle availability searches, significantly improved debugging capabilities, and a more resilient search system that prevents overbooking.`,

        'Hardened the new Indonesian address system by fixing a critical join error and implementing automatic `updated_at` timestamps for data integrity.',
      details: `Problem: A post-migration review of the new address system revealed two key issues:
1. A critical query was joining regencies and provinces using a non-key column (province_code) instead of the correct foreign key (province_id), risking query failures.
2. The new address tables (provinces, regencies, districts, villages) lacked a mechanism to automatically update the updated_at timestamp on modification, making audit trails unreliable.

What I changed:
- **Corrected Join Logic:** Updated the SQL query to join on the correct primary/foreign keys (r.province_id = p.id), ensuring data integrity and query stability.
- **Automated Timestamps:** Created a reusable trigger function, handle_updated_at(), that automatically sets updated_at to the current time on any row update. Applied this trigger to all four new address tables.

Example (Join Fix):
-- Before
JOIN public.indonesian_provinces p ON r.province_code = p.code
-- After
JOIN public.indonesian_provinces p ON r.province_id = p.id

Example (Timestamp Trigger):
\`\`\`sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_updated_at() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = NOW();
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER on_provinces_update
    BEFORE UPDATE ON public.indonesian_provinces
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_updated_at();
-- (Triggers also applied to regencies, districts, and villages)
\`\`\`

Result: The address system is now more robust, with reliable queries and accurate audit timestamps, completing the migration from the old system.`,

      details: `Problem: After switching address identifiers to Indonesian government codes (e.g., "31", "31.73"), several components still expected UUIDs â†’ RPCs failed and UI showed [object Object].

What I changed:
- Database: Added government_code columns and indexes for provinces/cities; updated RPCs (e.g., get_cities_by_province) to accept both government codes and UUIDs, trying gov-code first, then UUID, then name fallback.
- Frontend: Implemented formatLocationDisplay() to handle nested, flat, and legacy formats; eliminated [object Object] rendering by extracting name fields safely.
- Utilities: Dual-lookup helpers (getCityName/getProvinceName) with cache, trying UUID and gov-code; simplified branching and added graceful fallbacks.

Example (lookup helper):
export async function getCityName(cityIdentifier: string): Promise<string> {
  const supabase = createClient();
  // 1) try by government_code
  let { data } = await supabase
    .from('indonesian_cities')
    .select('name')
    .eq('government_code', cityIdentifier)
    .single();
  if (!data) {
    // 2) fallback to UUID
    const { data: byUuid } = await supabase
      .from('indonesian_cities')

      .eq('id', cityIdentifier)
      .single();
    data = byUuid || null;
  }
  return data?.name ?? cityIdentifier;

Result: UI shows readable location names; RPCs handle both formats; address rendering robust across data shapes.`,
